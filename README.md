# PROJECT 1

## Project Description

In this project, I was provided with data files and some questions to answer using those files.
The data described a beverage vendor's branches, the beverages available at each branch,
and how many consumers purchased each beverage.

I originally completed this project using the command line interface provided by beeline hive.
As such, I have included a powerpoint containing the scenarios, the queries to used to solve those scenarios,
and the outputs to those queries.
